* **`deploy`** - Will deploy a production build to the `gh-pages` branch.
* **`lint:log`** - Lint the app and save the results to `lint.log` file.
* **`lint:test`** - Lint the app and display the results in the terminal.
* **`lint:fix`** - Attempt to autofix linting issues.

# Development
To start development server and access the site at [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/)
```
npm run start
```

And if you only want to build the files
```
npm run build-only
```

# Deployment
The deployment process in this app only supports github pages using the `gh-pages` branch. To set it up:
1. Make necessary changes to your repository's settings.

Change the `source` to `gh-pages branch`.

If you have your own domain. Input your `custom domain` if you have and don't forget to add a `CNAME` file in the `public` folder. This will handle the redirecting from `github pages` to your custom domain.

2. In the `package.json` change the `homepage` property with the url where the app will be accessed
```
// for github pages domain
"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository_name>"

// for custom domains just put your own domain
"homepage": "<your_custom_domain_here>"
```
3. After setting up the correct url for `homepage` you can now deploy using
```
npm run deploy
```
This will build the files and deploy them to the `gh-pages` branch

4. Access your app with the url you used in the `homepage` property.
